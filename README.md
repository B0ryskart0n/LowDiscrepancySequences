# LowDiscrepancySequences

F# package implemenenting [low-discrepancy sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence) primarly used in [quasi Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method)

For now it's just a simple one file module. Maybe in the future this is going to become an outright package.
